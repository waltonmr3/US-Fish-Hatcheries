# US-Fish-Hatcheries
This map showcases the Fish and Wildlife Hatcheries run by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Each point represents an individual hatchery and is intended to demonstrate how many there are throughout the country. These establishments are crucial in the conservation world as they allow for rehabilitation of injured and endangered aquatic animals as well. In addition, hatcheries provide education for communities which helps individuals to care more deeply for the environment surrounding them and the animals that inhabit it. As stated on the map, many states even rely on aquaculture to stock lakes and rivers with fish populations for sustainable recreational fishing. All of these elements prove just how important hatcheries are and this map is a visual representation of how widespread they are throughout the country. There is an interactive information box featured on this map that describes the positive impacts of fish hatcheries as well as links users to more information regarding this topic. I hope you enjoy exploring!
